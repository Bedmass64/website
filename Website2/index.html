My education started at SMUS in 2007...

I went to Acadia in september of 2020

I learned some html and css and created this
website the summer of 2022. 

Another problem solving project I took on was the implemtation
of a game into this website. I first tryed using py-script
with my html and tryed to import pygame to start making the game
but came up with errors, after discovering that py-script was
not yet compatable with pygame, I dicided to create the game in
a python file using pygame and planned to have a download link in 
the game section of the website.

I then proceded to create my Simon Says clone game in but after 
consalting with a friend on the implimentation after finishing the
game. I dicided that it would look and work a lot better if I 
converted the game into javaScript since that could work nativiely 
with html and the person browsing the website wouldn't have to 
download pygame or have pylance installed. 

I am now currently working on converting my game into javaScript
in the game page of my website while I continue my third year at
Acadia Univeristy in Nova Scotia.
